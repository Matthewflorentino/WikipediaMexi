                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The next morning on 1 October, Basuki was contacted by the Army Headquarters and notified of the <a
                    href="/wiki/30_September_Movement" title="30 September Movement">kidnapping of the generals</a>,
                  including Yani, whom he had expected to be back in the palace as promised but ended up dead in his
                  house. Hearing this, Basuki together with an aide went in a car and took a drive around the city to
                  check what was going on. As he was driving, Basuki noticed his troops from East Java, the 530th
                  Infantry Battalion guarding the <a href="/wiki/Istana_Merdeka" class="mw-redirect"
                    title="Istana Merdeka">Presidential Palace</a> and was even more surprised that they were not
                  wearing any divisional patches nor rank insignia.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a
                      href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> After being advised against approaching them by his aide, Basuki
                  drove back to his accommodation where he was informed that he was needed at the <a
                    href="/wiki/Kostrad" title="Kostrad">Kostrad</a> headquarters.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Basuki went to the Kostrad headquarters to find that the commander of Kostrad, Major General <a
                    href="/wiki/Suharto" title="Suharto">Suharto</a>, had decided to assume the leadership of the Army
                  and take control of the situation. From Suharto, Basuki found out that a movement calling themselves
                  the 30 September Movement had used the troops to occupy strategic points in Jakarta. Suharto then told
                  Basuki that he needed him to negotiate the troops into surrendering before 6&nbsp;pm or else he would
                  use force. This, Basuki conveyed to the 530th Battalion who treated him with the utmost respect.
                  Basuki was successful and by 4&nbsp;pm, the 530th Battalion, in the presence of Kostrad forces,
                  surrendered.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During the day, the G30S Movement made an announcement of a Revolutionary Council on radio. Among the
                  names listed was that of Basuki. This was not an isolated incident as many anti-Communist general
                  officers such as <a href="/wiki/Umar_Wirahadikusumah" title="Umar Wirahadikusumah">Umar
                    Wirahadikusumah</a> (then commander, <a href="/wiki/Kodam_Jayakarta" title="Kodam Jayakarta">Kodam

                  on this council. Basuki was quick to deny the appointment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also during the day and unbeknownst to Basuki a meeting was held in <a
                    href="/wiki/Halim_Perdanakusuma_International_Airport"
                    title="Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport">Halim Perdanakusuma Airport</a> between Sukarno,
                  Commander of the Air Force AVM <a href="/wiki/Omar_Dhani" title="Omar Dhani">Omar Dhani</a>, Commander
                  of the Navy Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/RE_Martadinata" class="mw-redirect" title="RE Martadinata">RE
                    Martadinata</a>, and Chief of the National Police General Sucipto Judodiharjo to appoint a new Army
                  Commander. Although it was Major General Pranoto Reksosamudra who would be appointed Commander of the
                  Army to fill the by now vacant post, Basuki's name was briefly considered. It was quickly dismissed by
                  Sukarno who joked that Basuki would always be taken ill when the occasion needed him.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After 1 October, all the fingers pointed the blame at PKI and all over Indonesia, especially in Java,
                  movements began to be formed with the aim of crushing PKI. For his part, Basuki returned to East Java
                  to supervise the anti-PKI movements there.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>On 16 October 1965, a rally was held in Surabaya during which a United Action Command consisting of
                  various political parties was formed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Although he had encouraged the political parties to join the United Action Command, Basuki did not
                  commit his troops into cracking down on PKI as readily as all the other commanders did. During the
                  first weeks of a nationwide crackdown on PKI, nothing happened in the East Java capital of <a
                    href="/wiki/Surabaya" title="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>. This lack of commitment together with the
                  listing of Basuki's name as part of the Revolutionary Council caused many to suspect that Basuki was a
                  PKI sympathizer. It needed some force from his staff before Basuki froze pro-PKI activities in
                  Surabaya and East Java<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In November 1965, Basuki was transferred to Jakarta and became a staff member for Suharto who was now
                  the Commander of the Army, taking on the position of deputy chief of staff for finance and civil
                  relations. Basuki also become active as a member of the Social-Political Committee (<i>Panitia
                    Sospol</i>), the Army political think-tank which Suharto set up after he had become Commander of the
                  Army.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

                <br>
                <p>In February 1966, in a Cabinet Reshuffle, Basuki was named Minister of Veterans' Affairs. In this
                  duty he was tasked to ensure veterans' concerns would be addressed in light of the worsening economic
                  situation.

                <hr>
                <p>On 11 March 1966, Basuki attended a cabinet meeting at the Merdeka Palace, the first since Sukarno
                  reshuffled the cabinet at the end of February. The meeting had not been underway long before Sukarno,
                  after receiving a note from the commander of his bodyguards, suddenly left the room. When the meeting
                  was over, Basuki and the Minister of Industry, <a href="/wiki/M_Jusuf" class="mw-redirect"
                    title="M Jusuf">Mohammad Jusuf</a>, went outside the palace complex to join Amirmachmud, by now the
                  commander of KODAM V/Jaya replacing then Kostrad commanding general Umar Wirahadikusumah. Basuki was
                  then updated on what had happened and was informed that Sukarno had left for <a href="/wiki/Bogor"
                    title="Bogor">Bogor</a> by helicopter because it was not secure in Jakarta.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Jusuf suggested that the three of them go to Bogor to provide moral support for Sukarno. The other
                  two generals agreed and together, the three left to Bogor after asking for Suharto's permission.
                  According to Amirmachmud, Suharto asked the three generals to tell Sukarno of his readiness to restore
                  security, should the president order it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>At Bogor, the three met with Sukarno who was unhappy with the security and with Amirmachmud's
                  insistence that everything was secure. Sukarno then began discussing options with the three Generals
                  before finally Sukarno then began discussing options with Basuki, Jusuf, and Amirmachmud before
                  finally asking them how he can take care of the situation. Basuki and Jusuf were silent, but
                  Amirmachmud suggested that Sukarno give Suharto some powers and govern Indonesia with him so that
                  everything could be secured. The meeting then disbanded as Sukarno began preparing a Presidential
                  Decree.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>It was dusk when the Decree that would become Supersemar was finally prepared and awaiting Sukarno's
                  signature. Sukarno had some last minute doubts but Jusuf, together with the two Generals and Sukarno's
                  inner circle in the Cabinet who had also made the trip to Bogor encouraged him to sign. Sukarno
                  finally signed the letter. As the most senior out of the three Generals, Basuki was entrusted with the
                  letter and ordered to pass it on to Suharto. That night, the three Generals immediately went to the
                  Kostrad Headquarters and Basuki handed the letter to Suharto.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There was controversy over Basuki's role in Supersemar. One account states that four generals had
                  gone to Bogor, the fourth general being <a href="/wiki/Maraden_Panggabean"
                    title="Maraden Panggabean">Maraden Panggabean</a>. This account stated that together with
                  Panggabean, Basuki held Sukarno at gun point and forced him to sign a pre-prepared Supersemar which
                  Jusuf had carried with him inside a pink folder<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a
                      href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>On 13 March, Sukarno summoned Basuki, Jusuf, and Amirmachmud. Sukarno was angry that Suharto had
                  banned the PKI and told the three Generals that Supersemar did not contain such instructions. Sukarno
                  then ordered that a letter be produced to clarify the contents of Supersemar but nothing ever came up
                  apart from the copies that former Cuban Ambassador, AM Hanafi collected.

                  Cabinet more favorable to him. Basuki served as Minister of Home Affairs, starting with Suharto's
